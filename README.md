# Loan default Analysis- A Machine Learning Classification
## Project Details /Overview
The objective of this project is to examine and analyze instances of loan default and address specific inquiries related to the dataset. 
The dataset in question comprises information on previous loans, specifically the Loan_train.csv dataset, encompassing details of 346 customers, indicating whether their loans have been successfully repaid or have resulted in default.

This project uses machine learning model(KNN, Random Forest, Adaboost) to build a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not using attributes or features such as principal, terms (origination term can be weekly, biweekly and month payoff schedule), Age, education, gender and so on.
